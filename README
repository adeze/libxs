Welcome
-------

Crossroads I/O ("libxs") is a library for building scalable and high
performance distributed applications. It fits between classic BSD sockets,
JMS/AMQP-style message queues, and enterprise message-oriented middleware.

Crossroads I/O extends the standard socket interfaces with features
traditionally provided by specialised messaging middleware products,
providing an abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging
patterns, message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple
transport protocols, and more.

Crossroads I/O provides a native C API for applications. Support for many
more languages is provided by the community through language bindings which
can be found at the Crossroads website.


Building and Installation
-------------------------

The following instructions apply to building libxs from an official release
downloaded from the Crossroads I/O website. For building directly from Git,
refer to the `INSTALL` file included with the libxs distribution.

On POSIX platforms, libxs uses the standard autotools build system. To
build and install the library, ensure your system has a C++ compiler
installed, and proceed with the following steps:

1. Run `./configure`, then `make` to build the library.
2. Optionally, run `make check` to run the built in test suite.
3. Run `make install` as root.
4. On Linux or other platforms which use ld.so for dynamic linking, run
   `ldconfig` or equivalent as root to update your systems shared library
   cache.

On Windows, solution files for Visual C++ 2010 are provided in the
`builds/msvc/` subdirectory of the distribution.

Refer to the `INSTALL` file included with the libxs distribution for more
detailed installation instructions.


ZeroMQ Compatibility
--------------------

Crossroads I/O provides a drop-in 'libzmq' compatibility library for ZeroMQ
language bindings and applications. To enable 'libzmq' compatibility, you
must build your copy of libxs with the `--enable-libzmq` option to
configure, or on Windows by building the appropriate solution file.

For further details refer to the `doc/xs_zmq.html` or the 'xs_zmq(7)'
manual page included with this distribution.

NOTE: Enabling this option will *overwrite* any existing installation of
`libzmq` on your system.


Reporting Bugs
--------------

To report a bug, send an email describing your problem to the Crossroads
mailing list. To make sure your bug report won't be missed, you can file a
report in the bug tracker at <https://github.com/crossroads-io/libxs/issues>.

To help Crossroads developers to fix the bug, please try to provide a minimal
test program, ideally written in C, that reproduces the problem you are
reporting.

NOTE: The bug tracker exists primarily to track bugs and pertinent data (test
cases, crash logs, etc.). You should not use it for _discussion_. In the bug
tracker your audience will be very limited. Mailing list serves the purpose of
discussing bugs much better.


Contributing to the Project
---------------------------

Before contributing to the project make sure you understand the legal
implications of doing so. These are outlined on the Crossroads I/O website at

To submit your contribution, send it as a patch (using git format-patch, diff,
or similar) to the mailing list. Make sure to use your real name, and prefix
the subject of your post with `[PATCH]`.

All contributions will be reviewed and, if they pass review, accepted. For more
details refer to the website at <http://www.crossroads.io/dev:code-review>.
